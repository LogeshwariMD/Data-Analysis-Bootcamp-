# README: Web Scraping and Automation Tasks

## Overview
This document provides detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions for various web scraping and automation tasks using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. The tasks range from analyzing robots.txt files to scraping structured data from sports commentary pages and automating Instagram Reels scrolling.

---

## Task 1: Analyze robots.txt for Amazon, ESPNCricInfo, Instagram
**Description:**
- Check the `robots.txt` or Terms of Use for Amazon, ESPNCricInfo, and Instagram.
- Summarize the scraping limitations for each website.

**Expected Output:**
- A summary of the `robots.txt` file specifying what is allowed and restricted for web scraping.



**Steps to Complete:**
1. Open the `robots.txt` file for each website by visiting:
   - `https://www.amazon.com/robots.txt`
   - `https://www.espncricinfo.com/robots.txt`
   - `https://www.instagram.com/robots.txt`
2. Identify the `User-agent` directives and disallowed paths.
3. Summarize the limitations on scraping.

## Task 2: Scrape 1 Match Commentary (GT vs RR, Final)
**Description:**
- Extract structured ball-by-ball commentary from the GT vs RR final match.
- Ignore unnecessary commentary and extract relevant details.

**Expected Output:**
- A structured dataset with the following columns:
  - Ball No
  - Over
  - Bowler Name
  - Batter Name
  - Ball Type
  - Shot Type (boundary, single)
  - Speed of Ball
  - Runs Scored



**Steps to Complete:**
1. Use requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape the commentary page.
2. Parse the data to extract only ball-by-ball details.
3. Store the extracted data in a structured format (CSV, JSON, or DataFrame).
4. Modify the User-Agent if access is denied.

## Task 3: Scrape All Matches Commentary for IPL 2022
**Description:**
- Scrape all match commentary for the IPL 2022 season.
- Programmatically navigate through matches, without manually copying URLs.

**Expected Output:**
- A structured dataset with additional match details:
  - Match Name
  - Match Won By
  - Team 1 Score
  - Team 2 Score
  - Match Venue
  - Match Date



**Steps to Complete:**
1. Identify the page structure for accessing all match URLs.
2. Automate navigation through match pages.
3. Extract and store the structured ball-by-ball commentary.
4. Include match-level details in the dataset.

## Task 4: Scrape Multiple Series and All Matches Commentary
**Description:**
- Extend the previous task to scrape multiple IPL series (2021, 2022, 2023).
- Automate selecting different series from the dropdown.

**Expected Output:**
- A structured dataset including additional columns:
  - Series Name
  - Series Year



**Steps to Complete:**
1. Identify the dropdown menu structure for selecting different series.
2. Use Selenium to programmatically select each series.
3. Scrape match URLs and extract ball-by-ball commentary.
4. Append series metadata to the structured dataset.

## Bonus Task: Automate Instagram Reels Scrolling
**Description:**
- Automate scrolling through Instagram Reels using Selenium.
- Ensure the bot watches the full reel before scrolling.

**Expected Output:**
- A bot that watches a full reel before scrolling to the next.



**Steps to Complete:**
1. Install Selenium and ChromeDriver.
2. Check the installed Chrome version and download the matching ChromeDriver from GitHub.
3. Use Selenium to open Instagram and log in (if necessary).
4. Automate scrolling through Reels, ensuring each reel is fully watched.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

# Initialize WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path="./chromedriver")
driver.get("https://www.instagram.com/reels/")
time.sleep(5)

# Scroll through reels
while True:
    time.sleep(10)  # Adjust based on reel duration
    driver.find_element_by_tag_name("body").send_keys(Keys.ARROW_RIGHT)
```

---

## Additional Notes:
- Always check `robots.txt` before scraping a website.
- Use headers and User-Agent rotation to avoid blocks.
- Store data in structured formats for easy analysis.
- Ensure compliance with website terms and conditions.
- For Selenium tasks, keep ChromeDriver updated to match your Chrome version.

This guide provides a structured approach to completing web scraping and automation tasks effectively. Happy coding!
