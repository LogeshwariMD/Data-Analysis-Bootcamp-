## ðŸ“‚ Project Tasks

### âœ… Task 1: Understanding & Exploring Data Bias
- **Objective:** Detect and document biases in AI-generated responses.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use ChatGPT or another AI model to generate text based on specific prompts.
  - Identify and document biases in responses (e.g., assumptions about handedness, gender, or occupation).
  - Research additional common AI biases and compile a report.
- **Expected Output:** A **list of biases** found in AI-generated responses.
-

### âœ… Task 2: Data Cleaning & Exploration
- **Objective:** Identify potential biases in a **Customer Churn dataset**.
- **Implementation:**
  - Load and clean the dataset to handle missing values.
  - Analyze columns such as **gender, senior citizen status, payment method** to identify biased data points.
  - Document findings and discuss potential impacts of biases on customer retention models.
- **Expected Output:** A **list of biased columns** in the dataset with documentation.
-

### âœ… Task 3: Customer Segmentation
- **Objective:** Categorize customers into meaningful segments based on demographics, geography, and usage behavior.
- **Implementation:**
  - Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
  - Use clustering techniques (e.g., **K-Means, DBSCAN**) to segment customers.
  - Visualize segments using **bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots**.
- **Expected Output:** **Segmented customer groups with visualizations**.

### âœ… Task 4: Identify Customer Churn Indicators
- **Objective:** Analyze dataset features to identify top predictors of customer churn.
- **Implementation:**
  - Perform **correlation analysis** to find features most associated with churn.
  - Use **logistic regression or decision trees** to rank churn indicators.
  - Document insights on why customers churn.
- **Expected Output:** A **list of top features correlated with churn**.
- 

---

### âœ… Task 5: Suggest Retention Strategies
- **Objective:** Develop strategies to reduce customer churn based on insights from Task 4.
- **Implementation:**
  - Identify **root causes of churn**.
  - Recommend **pricing changes, customer support improvements, loyalty programs**.
  - Document findings and propose actionable steps for business leaders.
- **Expected Output:** A **detailed report** with insights and retention strategies.
