# Day2 Task



Using tools like **Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)** and **Excel/Google Sheets**, we generate various visualizations to better understand global progress.

## Project Objectives
- Explore historical and modern trends in health, wealth, and technology.
- Utilize data visualization techniques to create compelling insights.
- Replicate the impact of Hans Roslingâ€™s famous Gapminder charts.

## Tasks & Implementation
### ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Life Expectancy Over Time
#### Objective:
Analyze how life expectancy has changed across different countries over the years.

#### Implementation:
- Extract relevant data columns (Year, Country, Life Expectancy).
- Use **line charts** to visualize changes over time.
- Label axes, choose appropriate colors, and provide context.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Income Growth Trends
#### Objective:
Illustrate the trends in **average income** across various nations.

#### Implementation:
- Extract income-related data.
- Plot a **line chart** to track growth patterns.
- Ensure proper formatting and clarity in visualization.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 3: Mobile Phone Adoption
#### Objective:
Compare the rise in mobile phone usage across multiple countries.

#### Implementation:
- Extract **cell phones per person** data.
- Plot a **multi-line chart** to compare adoption rates.
- Include a legend for easy interpretation.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 4: Happiness Index Analysis
#### Objective:
Track and compare happiness scores for different countries.

#### Implementation:
- Extract data related to **Happiness Score (WHR)**.
- Create a **multi-line chart** to show trends over time.
- Use clear labels and interactive elements where possible.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 5: Visualizing Global Development with a Bubble Chart
#### Objective:
Recreate Hans Roslingâ€™s famous **Bubble Chart** to visualize global development.

#### Implementation:
- Utilize **income, life expectancy, and population size**.
- Create a **bubble chart**, where bubble size represents population.
- Include filters to analyze different years dynamically.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas)
- **Excel / Google Sheets**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** (for interactive analysis)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-visualization-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd data-visualization-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if using Python):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to generate the charts.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to enhance data storytelling by presenting key global indicators in an interactive and visually appealing manner. Whether using simple line charts or complex bubble visualizations, this analysis helps illustrate how the world has evolved over time.
